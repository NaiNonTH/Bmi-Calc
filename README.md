# BMI-Calc
A BMI Calculator, what's more?
## What is BMI-Calc?
BMI-Calc is made by NaiNonTheN00b1 as a small project which, well basically, calculates your BMI from your input weight and height. It also supports two popular (and only existing) units: Imperial and Metric.

For dark theme-rs, this BMI calculator also comes with auto dark mode supports as well :).
