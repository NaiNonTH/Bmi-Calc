# BMI-Calc
A BMI Calculator, what's more?
## What is BMI-Calc?
BMI-Calc is made by NaiNonTheN00b1 as a small webapp project which, well basically, calculates your BMI from your input weight and height. It also supports two popular (and only existing) units: Imperial and Metric.

For dark theme-rs, this BMI calculator also comes with auto dark mode supports as well :).
## How does it work?
To briefly explain, the site calculates your BMI from your input value, which will first check if it is valid â€” no characters or symbols aside from dot (.). If the value is valid, it will use the imported value to calculate the BMI with the following formula:

Weight (kg) / Height (m) ^ 2

Once finished, it will create an element that displays your BMI, both shortened and full on hover.
## What about units?
Although this BMI calculator supports the Imperial unit, it will eventually be converted to the Metric unit. This is for two reasons:
1. To fully support the Imperial unit without converting, I need to code another formula, which I'm too lazy to do so. (lol)
2. Even though I did code the formula for the Imperial unit, you won't be able to use units crossing each other, such as using Weight as kg, and height as ft.
## Themes?
This calculator also supports auto themes, including dark themes by adding a class, style with the dark color scheme. It uses Local Storage to save your theme preference.
## License?
My code is free to use. You can use them for anything you'd like.
## Suggestions
Suggestions are always welcome. I'm looking for any flaws to fix to better my web development skill (++ front-end). :D
